Toolbox for simulating neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles under 'release of inhibition' models in response to arbitrary calcium stimuli. Currently under development, see the *example* notebook for basic implementation.

The modelling framework and constraining of parameters are described in the [manuscript which has been submitted for publication](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2700789/v1) alongside this toolbox.
